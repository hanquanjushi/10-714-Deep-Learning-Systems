Returns the average error rate (as a *float*) and the average loss over all samples (as a *float*). Set the model to `training` mode at the beginning of the function if `opt` is given; set the model to `eval` if `opt` is not given (i.e. `None`). When setting the modes, use `.train()` and `.eval()` instead of modifying the training attribute.\n","\n","##### Parameters\n","- `dataloader` (*`needle.data.DataLoader`*) - dataloader returning samples from the training dataset\n","- `model` (*`needle.nn.Module`*) - neural network\n","- `opt` (*`needle.optim.Optimizer`*) - optimizer instance, or `None`\n","\n","___\n","\n","### Train Mnist\n","\n","`train_mnist(batch_size=100, epochs=10, optimizer=ndl.optim.Adam, lr=0.001, weight_decay=0.001, hidden_dim=100, data_dir=\"data\")`\n","                \n","Initializes a training dataloader (with `shuffle` set to `True`) and a test dataloader for MNIST data, and trains an `MLPResNet` using the given optimizer (if `opt` is not None) and the softmax loss for a given number of epochs.
