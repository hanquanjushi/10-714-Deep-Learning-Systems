# hw3
In this homework, we will build a simple backing library for the processing that underlies most deep learning systems: the n-dimensional array (a.k.a. the NDArray).  Up until now, we have largely been using numpy for this purpose, but this homework will walk we through developing what amounts to your own (albeit much more limited) variant of numpy, which will support both CPU and GPU backends.  What's more, unlike numpy (and even variants like PyTorch), we won't simply call out to existing highly-optimized variants of matrix multiplication or other manipulation code, but actually write your own versions that are reasonably competitive will the highly optimized code backing these standard libraries (by some measure, i.e., "only 2-3x slower" ...  which is a whole lot better than naive code that can easily be 100x slower).  This class will ultimately be integrated into needle, but for this assignment we can only focus on the ndarray module, as this will be the only subject of the tests.
